# Troubleshooting

If your are facing any issues logging in, connecting etc. you should first
 make sure you are running the latest version.

If you are running Docker, run:

```bash
docker pull timmo001/home-panel
docker pull timmo001/home-panel-api
```

and run the containers again.

If running natively, checkout the latest version from the release page for
 the [app] and the [API].

If you are still having issues, you can post on the Home Assistant
 [forum thread] where the community will be able to help you if not myself.
